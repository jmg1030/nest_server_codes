Name: topology::CreateLayer - create a spatial layer of nodes

  Synopsis:
  dict CreateLayer -> layer

  Parameters:
  dict - dictionary with layer specification

  Description: The Topology module organizes neuronal networks in
  layers. A layer is a special type of subnet which contains information
  about the spatial position of its nodes. There are three classes of
  layers: grid-based layers, in which each element is placed at a
  location in a regular grid; free layers, in which elements can be
  placed arbitrarily in space; and random layers, where the elements are
  distributed randomly throughout a region in space.  Which kind of layer
  this command creates depends on the elements in the supplied
  specification dictionary.
