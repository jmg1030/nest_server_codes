Name: put_d - Add an entry to a dictionary

   Synopsis: <<dict>> /key val -> <<dict>>

   Description:
     put_d adds the pair /key value to the supplied dictionary.
     If /key was already defined in that dictionary, its old
     value is lost.

     In contrast to PostScript dictionaries, only literal names can
     be used as keys in a dictionary.

   Parameters:
     dict - a dictionary
     /key - a literal name
     val  - an object of arbitrary type

   Examples:

     userdict /a 1 put_d
     << >> /a 1 put_d

   Diagnostics:
     No errors are raised.
