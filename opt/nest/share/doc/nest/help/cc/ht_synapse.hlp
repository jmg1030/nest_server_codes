Name: ht_synapse - Synapse with depression after Hill & Tononi (2005).

  Description:
  This synapse implements the depression model described in [1, p 1678].
  Synaptic dynamics are given by

  P'(t) = ( 1 - P ) / tau_p
  P(T+) = (1 - delta_P) P(T-)   for T : time of a spike
  P(t=0) = 1

  w(t) = w_max * P(t)  is the resulting synaptic weight

  Parameters:
     The following parameters can be set in the status dictionary:
     tauP     double - synaptic vesicle pool recovery time constant [ms]
     delta_P  double - fractional change in vesicle pool on incoming spikes [unitless]
     P        double - current size of the vesicle pool [unitless, 0 <= P <= 1]

  Warning:
  THIS SYNAPSE MODEL HAS NOT BEEN TESTED EXTENSIVELY!
