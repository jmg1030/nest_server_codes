Name: raiseagain - re-raise the last error
 Synopsis:  raiseagain

 Description:
   raiseagain re-raises a previously raised error. This is useful
   if an error handler cannot cope with a particular error (e.g. a signal)
   and wants to pass it to an upper level handler. Thus, nestet error handlers
   are possible.

 Bugs: lets wait...
