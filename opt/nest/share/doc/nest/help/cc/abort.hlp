Name: abort - Abort all NEST processes gracefully.
   Paramteres:
   exitcode - The exitcode to quit with
   Description:
   This function can be run by the user to end all NEST processes as
   gracefully as possible. If NEST is compiled without MPI support,
   this will just call quit_i. If compiled with MPI support, it will
   call MPI_Abort, which will kill all processes of the application
   and thus prevents deadlocks. The exitcode is userabort in both
   cases (see statusdict/exitcodes).
