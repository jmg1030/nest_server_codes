Name: ofsopen - Open an existing file for appending or writing.
   Synopsis: (name) (mode) ofsopen -> ofstreamhandle true
   -> false
   Parameters: (name) - name of the file.
   (mode) - string with either (w) or (a) to identify
   the access mode. (w) corresponds to writing
   and (a) to appending.
   Description:
   Open the named file according to the access mode. If the file
   is not existing, it will be created in the current working directory.
   If the file does exists, the access mode decides whether the file will
   be overwritten (w) or whether the new data will be appended (a).
   If successful an ofstream handle object and the boolean true is returned.
   In case of failure, only the boolean
   false is returned. This function provides a direct interface to the
   C++ ofstream constructor. SLI's search path mechanism is not used.
