Name: stdp_pl_synapse_hom - Synapse type for spike-timing dependent
   plasticity with power law implementation using homogeneous parameters, i.e.
   all synapses have the same parameters.

  Description:
   stdp_pl_synapse is a connector to create synapses with spike time
   dependent plasticity (as defined in [1]).


  Parameters:
   tau_plus  double - Time constant of STDP window, potentiation in ms
                      (tau_minus defined in post-synaptic neuron)
   lambda    double - Learning rate
   alpha     double - Asymmetry parameter (scales depressing increments as alpha*lambda)
   mu        double - Weight dependence exponent, potentiation

  Remarks:
   The parameters can only be set by SetDefaults and apply to all synapses of the model.
