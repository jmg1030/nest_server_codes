Name: xifstream - Create an executable input-stream.
  Synopsis: (filename) xifstream -> file true
  -> false
  Description: xifstream first tries to open a file
  by the given name. If this was successful, it creates
  an executable stream-handle.
  If an executable stream is executed (e.g. with exec),
  the interpreter parses this file according to SLI syntax
  and evaluates all contained objects.
