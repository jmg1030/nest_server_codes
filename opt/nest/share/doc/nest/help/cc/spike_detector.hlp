Name: spike_detector - Device for detecting single spikes.

Description:
The spike_detector device is a recording device. It is used to record
spikes from a single neuron, or from multiple neurons at once. Data
is recorded in memory or to file as for all RecordingDevices.
By default, GID and time of each spike is recorded.

The spike detector can also record spike times with full precision
from neurons emitting precisely timed spikes. Set /precise_times to
achieve this.

Any node from which spikes are to be recorded, must be connected to
the spike detector using a normal connect command. Any connection weight
and delay will be ignored for that connection.

Simulations progress in cycles defined by the minimum delay. During each
cycle, the spike detector records (stores in memory or writes to screen/file)
the spikes generated during the previous cycle. As a consequence, any
spikes generated during the cycle immediately preceding the end of the simulation
time will not be recorded. Setting the /stop parameter to at the latest one
min_delay period before the end of the simulation time ensures that all spikes
desired to be recorded, are recorded.

Spike are not necessarily written to file in chronological order.
