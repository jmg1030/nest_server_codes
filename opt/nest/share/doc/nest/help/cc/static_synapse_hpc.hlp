Name: static_synapse_hpc - Variant of static_synapse with low memory consumption.

     Description:
     hpc synapses store the target neuron in form of a 2 Byte index instead of an
     8 Byte pointer. This limits the number of thread local neurons to 65,536.
     No support for different receptor types.
     Otherwise identical to static_synapse.
