Name: stop - raise a stop signal
Synopsis:
  stop -> -

Desctiption:
  stop causes the execution stack to be popped until an
  enclosing stopped context is found. Effectively, the
  stopped/stop combination equals the catch/throw pair of
  C++.
  stop/stopped is used to implement SLI's error handling
  capabilities.
Notes: stop, stopped is PostScript compatible.
