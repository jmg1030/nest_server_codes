Name: topology::DumpLayerNodes - write information about layer nodes to file

  Synopsis: ostream layer_gid DumpLayerNodes -> ostream

  Parameters:
  ostream   - open output stream
  layer_gid - topology layer

  Description:
  Write information about each element in the given layer to the
  output stream. The file format is one line per element with the
  following contents:

  GID x-position y-position [z-position]

  X and y position are given as physical coordinates in the extent,
  not as grid positions. The number of decimals can be controlled by
  calling setprecision on the output stream before calling DumpLayerNodes.

  Remarks:
  In distributed simulations, this function should only be called for
  MPI rank 0. If you call it on several MPI ranks, you must use a
  different file name on each.

  Examples:

  topology using
  /my_layer << /rows 5 /columns 4 /elements /iaf_neuron >> CreateLayer def

  (my_layer_dump.lyr) (w) file
  my_layer DumpLayerNodes
  close
