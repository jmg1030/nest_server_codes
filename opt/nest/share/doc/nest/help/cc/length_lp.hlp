Name: length_lp - counts elements of a literal procedure
 Synopsis: literal procedure length_lp -> int

 Examples: { {1 2 3} } 0 get length_lp -> 3

 Remarks: 0 get is needed to make sure that procedure is still
literal procedure, when it is evaluated. Use length if you are
not sure of the data type.
