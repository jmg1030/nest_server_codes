Name: poisson_generator_ps - simulate neuron firing with Poisson processes
(with arbitrary dead time) statistics and exact timing
Description:

  The poisson_generator_ps generator simulates a neuron firing with Poisson
  statistics (with dead time), ie, exponentially distributed interspike
  intervals plus constant dead time, spike events have exact timing
  (i.e. not binned).

Parameters:
   The following parameters appear in the element's status dictionary:

   rate     - mean firing rate. (double, var)
   dead_time - minimal time between two spikes. (double, var)

Remarks:
   - This generator must be connected to all its targets using the
     same synapse model. Failure to do so will only be detected at
     runtime.
   - This generator has only been validated in a very basic manner.

   Sends: SpikeEvent
