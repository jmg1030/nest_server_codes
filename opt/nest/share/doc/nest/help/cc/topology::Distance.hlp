Name: topology::Distance - compute distance between nodes

  Synopsis: from_gid to_gid Distance -> double
            from_pos to_gid Distance -> double

  Parameters:
  from_gid    - int, gid of node in a topology layer
  from_pos    - double vector, position in layer
  to_gid      - int, gid of node in a topology layer

  Returns:
  double - distance between nodes or given position and node

  Description:
  This function returns the distance between the position of the "from_gid"
  node or the explicitly given "from_pos" position and the position of the
  "to_gid" node. Nodes must be parts of topology layers.

  The "from" position is projected into the layer of the "to_gid" node. If
  this layer has periodic boundary conditions (EdgeWrap is true), then the
  shortest distance is returned, taking into account the
  periodicity. Fixed grid layers are in this case extended so that the
  nodes at the edges of the layer have a distance of one grid unit when
  wrapped.

  Example:

  topology using
  << /rows 5
     /columns 4
     /elements /iaf_neuron
  >> CreateLayer ;

  4 5         Distance
  [0.2 0.3] 5 Distance
