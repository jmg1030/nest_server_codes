Name: iaf_psc_exp_multisynapse - Leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model with multiple ports.

Description:

 iaf_psc_exp_multisynapse is a direct extension of iaf_psc_exp.
 On the postsynapic side, there can be arbitrarily many synaptic
 time constants (iaf_psc_exp has exactly two: tau_syn_ex and tau_syn_in).

 This can be reached by specifying separate receptor ports, each for
 a different time constant. The port number has to match the respective
 "receptor_type" in the connectors.

Sends: SpikeEvent

Receives: SpikeEvent, CurrentEvent, DataLoggingRequest
