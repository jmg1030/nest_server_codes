Name: ht_neuron - Neuron model after Hill & Tononi (2005).

   Description:
   This model neuron implements a slightly modified version of the
   neuron model described in [1]. The most important properties are:

   - Integrate-and-fire with threshold that is increased on spiking
     and decays back to an equilibrium value.
   - No hard reset, but repolarizing potassium current.
   - AMPA, NMDA, GABA_A, and GABA_B conductance-based synapses with
     beta-function (difference of two exponentials) time course.
   - Intrinsic currents I_h (pacemaker), I_T (low-threshold calcium),
     I_Na(p) (persistent sodium), and I_KNa (depolarization-activated
     potassium).

   In comparison to the model described in the paper, the following
   modifications were mare:

   - NMDA conductance is given by g(t) = g_peak * m(V), where

       m(V) = 1 / ( 1 + exp( - ( V - NMDA_Vact ) / NMDA_Sact ) )

     This is an approximation to the NMDA model used in [2].

   - Several apparent typographical errors in the descriptions of
     the intrinsic currents were fixed, hopefully in a meaningful
     way.

   I'd like to thank Sean Hill for giving me access to his
   simulator source code.

   See examples/hilltononi for usage examples.

   Warning:
   THIS MODEL NEURON HAS NOT BEEN TESTED EXTENSIVELY!
