Name: forallindexed - Call a procedure for each element of a list/string

   Synopsis:
     [v1,...,vn] {f} forallindexed ->  f(0,v1),...,f(n-1,vn)

   Parameters:
     [v1,...,vn] - list of n arbitrary objects or string
     {f}         - function which can operate on the elements of the
                   array. f is not required to return a specific number
                   of values.

   Description:
     For each element of the input array, forallindexed calls f with
     two arguments, the element and its index within the list/string.
     forallindexed is similar to forall, only that the index of the
     element is also passed to the function f.

     Alternatives: Functions forallindexed_a for a list, forallindexed_s
     for a string (both undocumented) -> behaviour and synopsis are the same.

   Examples:

   [(a) (b)]  {} forallindexed -> (a) 0 (b) 1
