Name: testsuite::test_random_divergent_connect - sli script to test the RandomDivergentConnect function using global rng.

   Synopsis: (test_random_divergent_connect) run -> compare response with reference data

   Description: Tests the use of the RandomDivergentConnect function by 
   creating a single one-to-many connection with this function. The test
   script confirms that the function creates the right number of connections
   and that the connections are in the list of possible connections. The
   actual distribution of the connections is not tested.
