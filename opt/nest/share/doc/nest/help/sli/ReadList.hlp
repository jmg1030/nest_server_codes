Name: ReadList - read a list of specified format from a stream
Synopsis: istream [types] ReadList -> [result]
Parameters: istream : an input stream
            [types] : an array with one or more of the following type specifiers:
                      Number - specifies a real number
                      Double - specifies a real number
                      Integer- specifies an integer
                      Word   - a white space separated string
                      String - a text line terminated with a newline character
 
Description: ReadList reads the rest of a file into an array. If [types] contains
             more than one type specifier, the array is constructed from subarray with
             elements of the types, specified by  [types].

 	     ReadList tries to allocate the result array in advance. The option
	     BufferSize can be specified to optimize this behaviour.

             The valid type specifiers are defined in the ReadModes dictionary.              
         
Examples: istream [/Number /Number] ReadList -> [[1 2] [3 4] ...]
          istream [/Number] ReadList -> [1 2 3 4 ...] 
 
References: ReadList approximates the Mathematica function.
