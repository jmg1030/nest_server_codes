Name: testsuite::ticket-433 - Test against receptor_type mishandling in ht_neuron

Synopsis: (ticket-433) run -> NEST exits if test fails

Description:
 ht_neuron accepted incoming connections with invalid receptor type, leading to
 unpredictable errors. Additionally, the topology library did not seem to pass
 on the receptor_type when making connections.
