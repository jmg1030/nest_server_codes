Name: testsuite::test_aeif_cond_alpha_multisynapse - sli script for the aeif multisynapse model

   Synopsis: (test_aeif_cond_alpha_multisynapse) run

   Description:
   This test creates a multisynapse neuron and first checks if time constants
   can be set correctly. 
   Afterwards, it simulates the mutisynapse neuron with n (n=4) different time 
   constants and records the neuron's synaptic current. At the same time, it simulates 
   n (n=4) single synapse neurons with according parameters.
   At the end, it compares the multisynapse neuron currents with each according single 
   synapse current.
