             and executes the given command in that child process.
             Depending on the value of "Flag", the parent process will
             wait for the child to terminate or continue execution in
             parallel.
             The command may be given either as a string containing
             the command name and all options, or as an array of
             strings, specifying the command name and every single
             option.
             If you are interested in communicating to the child process
             via pipes, see "spawn" or "shpawn".

	     Alternatives: Functions system_as_i_p with array or
	     string and integer(flag) and precode, system_as_di_i_p 
	     with array or string and dictionary followed by
	     integer(flag) and precode (both undocumented) -> behaviour and
	     synopsis are the same.

</pre></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><b>Parameters:</b></td><td valign="top"><pre> In : CommandString(string)/CommandArray(array of string):
                      The UNIX command to execute.
                      Either a string containing the command and all
                      parameters, or an array of strings, containing the
                      command and the parameters in separate (see "sysexec").

                 Flag: 0: Wait for termination of child process.
                           A flag indicating if the child process exited
                           normally or abnormally, and the exit status is
                           left on the stack.
                       1: Return immediately. This is the "no-care-mode".
                           An orphaned grandchild process is created.
                               I.e. a child is forked, which again forks
                           a child and then exits. The orphaned grandchild
                           is inherited by the init-process immediately,
                           which will perform any waiting.
                           This is a legal way of producing a child you don't
                           have to wait for. (However, see remarks below.)
                           - All ressources occupied by the child process will
                             be automatically released with its termination. -
                          No result is left on the stack.
                       2: Return immediately.
                           Create a normal child process and return immediately,
                           leaving it's PID on the stack.
                           ! The parent has to call "wait" or "waitPID" in order
                             to free the ressources occupied by the child process
                             after it's termination !
                      
                       The "Flag" parameter may be omitted in which case
                        it defaults to zero.

                 Precode(executable procedure):
                       -This parameter is for internal use with the "spawn"
                        command. However, it is documented here for there may be 
                        unexpected applications.-
                       In "Precode" there can be supplied a sequence of SLI
                       commands that will be executed by the child process
                       prior to calling "sysexec". The main application
                       is to instruct the child process to redirect it's
                       standard input/output to a pipe, as does the "spawn"
                       command (for a example, see the code of "spawn").

                       
            Out: NormalExitFlag(boolean):
                       True, if the child terminated normally, i.e. by a call to
                       exit() or by returning from main(). In that case, the exit
                       code is reported in the Status argument (see below).
                       False, if the child terminated due to a signal that was
                       not caught. In that case, the number of that signal is
                       reported in the Status argument (see below).
     	    
                 Status(integer):
                       If NormalExitFlag is true, this reports the child's exit
                       code, i.e. the low-order eight bits of the status argument
                       that the child passed to exit(), or the value the child
                       process returned from main().
                       If NormalExitFlag is false, this reports the number of the
                       signal that caused the termination of the child process.
                       Look up this number in signaldict, to know what it means.

                 ChildPID(integer): The process ID of the newly created child.

</pre></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><b>Remarks:</b></td><td valign="top"><pre> The no-care-mode (Flag=2) gives no way to know about the
         child`s exit code. If you need to care about the exit code,
         use Flag=0, which will leave it on the stack, or use Flag=1
         and get the exit code by calling "wait" or "waitPID".

         If you are interested in communicating to the child process
         via pipes, see "spawn" or "shpawn".

To Do:   It should be possible to spawn a parallel SLI Process. This
         should be supported by a future version. Actually, as this is
         the more general case, the spoon/system/spawn chain of commands
         could be restructured.
