Name: cvgidcollection - Create a container of global ids.

   Synopsis:
   list_of_gids          cvgidcollection -> gidcollection

   Parameters:
   list_of_gids    - an array or intvector of global ids, or a gidcollection
   first_gid       - an integer definig the first GID of the range
   last_gid        - an integer definig the last GID of the range
