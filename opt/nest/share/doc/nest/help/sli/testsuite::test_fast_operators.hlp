Name: testsuite::test_fast_operators - ensures that internal operators do not check number of arguments

Synopsis: (test_fast_operators) run

Description: 
User level operators like add and pop in SLI are safe in the sense that a StackUnderflow error is 
raised if the stack does not contain a sufficient number of arguments. The user can then inspect the
state of the interpreter and solve the problem. In machine generated SLI code, however, checking the
number of arguments is unnecessary.
