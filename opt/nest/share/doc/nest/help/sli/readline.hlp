Name: readline - read and edit a line from standard input

Synopsis: any readline -> any true
                       -> false

Description: readline takes anything from the prompt as a string and prints it.
If something is added, readline pushes the additional phrase as string
plus a true on the stack (that means readline reads a line from
standard input). If nothing is added false is pushed.
