Name: testsuite::test_multimeter_stepping - test if multimeter returns same values for stepped simulation

Synopsis: (test_multimeter_stepping.sli) run -> dies if assertion fails

Description:
The script checks all models providing a "recordables" entry in their
status dict.  It creates a multimeter, sets it to record from all
recordables. The neuron receives Poisson input. This is done once for
a single 50 x MinDelay simulation and once for 50 subsequent MinDelay simulations. The test passes
if both cases produce identical results.
