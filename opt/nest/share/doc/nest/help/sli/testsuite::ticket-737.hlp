Name: testsuite::ticket-737 - ensure generators depending on port info detect "bad wiring"

Synopsis: (ticket-737-DScallback) run -> NEST exits if test fails

Description: 
This tests ensures that generators relying on port information to provide target-specific
output via the DS-callback mechanism verify that all callback connections have a contiguous
port range starting from 0.

Remarks: 
This test does not work properly until #681 is fixed, because exceptions thrown in parallel
sections are not handled properly.
