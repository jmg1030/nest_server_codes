Name: testsuite::ticket-541 - Regression test for aeif_cond_alpha reset

Synopsis: (ticket-541) run -> NEST exits if test fails

Description:
This test is based on an original Python demonstrator by Abigail Morrison
(see #541).
Per r10018, no-one can reproduce the error and the test is very slow.
Therefore, this test resides in manualtests.
