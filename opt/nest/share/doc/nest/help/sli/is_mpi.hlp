Name: is_mpi - flag in statusdict indicating whether interpreter was compiled with MPI 

Synopsis: statusdict/is_mpi :: -> boolean

Description:
The C++ startup of a SLI interpreter which is not compiled with MPI support may 
be completely unaware of distributed computing and may therefore not define the /is_mpi 
flag. In order to simplify user code, processes.sli sets /is_mpi to false if it is
not defined.
