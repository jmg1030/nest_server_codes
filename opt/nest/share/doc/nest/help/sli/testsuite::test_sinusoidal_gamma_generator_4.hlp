Name: testsuite::test_sinusoidal_gamma_generator_4 - Test parallel generation of sinusoidally modulate Gammaian trains with individual spike trains

Synopsis: nest_indirect test_sinusoidal_gamma_generator_4.sli -> -

Description:
   Creates a sinusoidally modulated Gamma generator emitting
   individual spike trains to each of its targets and sends spikes to
   spike detector. Identical to ..._2, but with single generator, not one per VP.
