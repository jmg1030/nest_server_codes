Name: testsuite::ticket-451 - Guard against infinte loops in Random*Connect

Synopsis: (ticket-451) run -> NEST exits if test fails

Description:
 Random connection routines can hang in infinite loops if the user request
 more connections than possible if restrictions on multapses and autapses
 are taken into account. This test ensures that such conditions are caught.
