Name: testsuite::test_iaf_psc_alpha_multisynapse - sli script for the multisynapse model

   Synopsis: (test_iaf_psc_alpha_multisynapse) run

   Description:
   This test creates a multisynapse neuron and first checks if time constants
   can be set correctly. Afterwards, it simulates with four different time constants
   and records the neuron's synaptic current. The expected PSC-maxima are
   calculated and compared with the simulated currents.
