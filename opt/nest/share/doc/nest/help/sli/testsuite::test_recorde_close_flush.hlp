Name: testsuite::test_recorde_close_flush - test {close,flush}_after_simulate flags for recording devices

Description:
Two voltmeters record from an iaf_neuron driven by an intrisic
current. One voltmeter has close_after_simulate set, the other
flush_after_simulate. After simulating for 100ms, the two files must
have identical content. After simulating for another 100ms, the
flushed file must contain data for 200ms, the "closed" file for the
second 200ms only.
