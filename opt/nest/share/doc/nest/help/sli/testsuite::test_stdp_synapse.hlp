Name: testsuite::test_stdp_synapse - basic test of stdp_synapse

Synopsis: (test_stdp_synapse) run

Description:
  A parrot_neuron that repeats the spikes from a poisson generator is
  connected to an iaf_psc_alpha that is driven by inh. and exc. poisson input.
  The synapse is an stdp_synapse. After the simulation, we go through the pre-
  and postsyn. spike-trains spike by spike and try to reproduce the STDP
  results. The final weight obtained after simulation is compared to the final
  weight obtained from the test.
