Name: testsuite::test_stdp_hom_poiss - sli script to test stdp_synapse_hom model 
implementing spike time dependent plasticity syanpses 
according to Guetig et al. (2003), Journal of Neuroscience. It uses the version of these synapses, which uses homogeneous parameter, i.e. all STDP synapses have the same parameters. 
This script performs repeated spike pairing of two neurons connected by a stdp_synapse.
The synapse strength is recorded after 60 paired spikes in a file.



Synopsis: (test_stdp) run -> compare cout with comments in file
