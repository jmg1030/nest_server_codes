Name: message - Display an information message

Synopsis:
(Message) Priority        message -> -
Priority (From) (Message) message ->

where "Priority" may be any positive integer, or one of the following:
M_DEBUG, M_STATUS, M_INFO, M_WARNING, M_ERROR, M_FATAL

Description: 
Display a message, if priority is higher than current verbosity-level. 
message uses the message mechanism which is provided
by the SLIInterpreter class.

The output consists of a time-stamp (date and time), the name of the
calling function, the priority level and the message text.


% month dd hh:mm::ss from[pl] messagetext

Where
   month - abbreviated month (Jan-Dec)
   dd    - day in month (01-31)
   hh    - hour (00-23)
   mm    - minute (00-61)
   ss    - seconds (00-61)
   from  - name of the caller, defaults to (SLI) in the short form
   pl    - priority level of the message
   
The time-stamp is useful during long-running simulations.  

All output is sent to the stream defined in M_OUT which is
set to cout by default.

The verbosity level can be controlled by the functions
verbosity and setverbosity. For compatibility, the function
shutupto is still supported as alias to setverbosity.

Parameters: 
In : (MyMessage: Message to display
     Priority  : Priority level of message (integer).
Opt: (From)    : Name of the caller of class of message.

Remarks: 
         M_* values are defined in system dictionary.
         You may introduce new priority levels in the user dictionary if convenient.
         Standard values are: M_ALL    = 0
                              M_DEBUG   = 5
                              M_STATUS  = 7
                              M_INFO    = 10
                              M_WARNING = 20
                              M_ERROR   = 30
                              M_FATAL   = 40
                              M_QUIET   = 100
         Standard output:     M_OUT     = cout
