Name: searchfile - tries to open a file for reading using one of
       the pathes given within an array of pathnames.
 Synopsis: (filename) [pathnames] searchfile -> istream true
                                         -> false
 Description:
   searchfile concatenates every pathname with the filename and
   calls ifstream until ifstream was able to open the file or until no
   other path is left. In ordinary cases you will not call searchfile,
   but searchifstream. Call searchfile if you want to use customized
   search pathes.
 Diagnostics:
   The routine issues debugging messages of priority M_DEBUG
   displaying the search status.
 Parameters:
   string is the filename, while array contains pathname strings.
 Examples: test.dat [(./) (~/) (/home/synod/)] tries to open test.dat for
   reading using the current, your user, and the /home/synod/ path one
   after the other. It opens the first test.dat found along the way,
   or returns false if there is no one in neither path.
