</pre></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><b>Description:</b></td><td valign="top"><pre> "dup2" is a wrapper to the "dup2()" UNIX system call.
             This is a low-level file operation. It does not operate on
             filestreams, but on the underlying UNIX file descriptors.
             
             Operation:
              1. "dup2" gets the file descriptors fd1 and fd2, to which
                 the two streams are bound. (See remarks below!)
              2. System function dup2(fd1, fd2) is called. This means:
                  o If fd1 equals fd2, nothing is done.
                  o If not, the file associated with fd2, if any, is closed.
                    fd2 is then attached to the same file as fd1. It refers
                    to the same open file as fd1 and shares any locks.
                     Thus, the values of fd1 and fd2 stay unchanged, but
                    fd2 refers to a different file after the call.
                     Respectively, C++-stream2 stays unchanged in every
                    detail (buffer, value of undelying file descriptor, ...)
                    but is actually connected to a different file.

             "dup2" will usually be called on "cin", "cout" or "cerr" after 
             a "fork" or "spoon" and prior to calling "sysexec". This is
             used to redirect the standard channels of the newly created
             process to a file, pipe or fifo. For a typical call see
             examples below.
              In a UNIX environment, each process expects the standard
             channels stdin, stdout, stderr to be associated to three 
             special file descriptors (usually 0, 1 and 2). Thus, if a parent
             process redirects one of these descriptors explicitely, a
             child process will inherit this redirection and read/write
             to a file when accessing cin/cout/cerr/clog WITHOUT
             NOTICING.

	     Alternatives: Functions dup2_is_is for two istreams, 
	     dup2_os_os for two osstreams (both undocumented) 
	     -> behaviour and synopsis are the same.

                i/ostream2: The stream to be re-directed. The file
                            associated to this stream will be closed, and
                            this stream will be associated to the same file
                            as i/ostream1.

             % of the pipe.

</pre></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><b>Remarks:</b></td><td valign="top"><pre> This is a typesafe wrapper to "dup2_is_is" and "dup2_os_os"
         which operate on two input streams and two output streams
         respectively. The code for these functions can be found in
         file "synod2/sli/processes.{h|cc}".

          It sure is not a bad idea to flush ostream2 prior to the
         call, as it will be connected to another file afterwards, but
         any buffered data stays unchanged!

          Getting the file descriptors from C++-filestreams is not yet
         supported by a POSIX call. (There is such a call for C-filestreams,
         however). The code used here may be implementation dependent and
         not fully portable! As soon as there is a reliably portable way
         to detect file descriptors from a C++-filestream (or convert a C++
         stream to a C stream), the respective code found in function
         Processes::fd(), file "synod2/sli/processes.cc", should be changed.
