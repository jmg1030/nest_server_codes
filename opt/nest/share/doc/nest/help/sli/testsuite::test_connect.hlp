Name: testsuite::test_connect - SLI script to test runability of all Connect variants

   Synopsis: (test_connect) run

   Description:

   Tests if all variants of Connect can be run. This test checks the
   outcome of the calls only in a minimal way. A more comprehensive
   set of tests is available in PyNEST. It also checks the given
   parameters more thoroughly and looks at statistics of the resulting
   connectivity.
