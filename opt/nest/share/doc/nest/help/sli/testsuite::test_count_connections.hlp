Name: testsuite::test_count_connections - Test connection counting for total
number of connections and specific types of connections.

Synopsis: (test_count_connections) run -> NEST exits if test fails

Description: 
This test uses RandomConvergentConnect to connect a net of 100 neurons
to itself, with 100 connections per neuron, a total of 10000 connections.
It is checked whether the total number of connections and the number of
static connections equals 10000. Then additional 10000 connections of type
stdp_synapse are created. It is checked whether the total number of
connections is 20000 and the number of stdp connections is 10000.
