Name: unittest::failbutnocrash_or_die - Execute a code block and exit with exit code 3 if it does not raise a scripterror

Synopsis: { code } [string] failbutnocrash_or_die -> -

Description:
The procedure tests that a specific error, a scripterror, is raised. An example
is a call of operator add in a situation where the operand stack is empty. add
raises a StackUnderflow error in this case which is a scripterror and the desired
behavior. There are several alternative and undesired behaviors of the code block
in question. add may return without raising an error, this is not the expected behavior
and therefore failbutnocrash_or_die reports a problem. However, other scenarios 
are that the code block causes an assertion to fail or that it causes a segmentation
fault. In contrast to fail_or_die, failbutnocrash_or_die survives such a crash of
the code block to be tested. This is achieved by probing the code block in a separate
nest instance and inspecting the result. The procedure uses the symbolic exit codes
defined in statusdict::exitcodes, scripterror is one of them.

Diagnostics:
This function will quit nest  (exit code 3) if the code does NOT raise an error of the 
scripterror type. It will print an error message to cerr, too.

Examples:
 {add}     (add ok) failbutnocrash_or_die  -> success
 {1 0 div} failbutnocrash_or_die  -> success
 {add_dd}  failbutnocrash_or_die  -> quit
