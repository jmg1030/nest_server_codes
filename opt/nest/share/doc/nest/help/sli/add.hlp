Name: add - add two numbers or vectors
Synopsis: n1 n2  add -> n3
          a1 a2  add -> a3
Description: add can be used to add numbers and arrays.

  If applied to numbers, add returns the sum of the numbers. If one
  of the arguments is a double, the result is also a double.

  Applied to arrays, add perfoms a per-component addition of the two
  arrays. The components must be numbers, however, integer and double
  values may be mixed.

  Note that the two arrays must be of the same size.


Examples:
           1 2   add -> 3
           1.0 2 add -> 3.0
           [1 2] [3 4] add -> [4 6]
           1 [3 4] add -> [4 5]
