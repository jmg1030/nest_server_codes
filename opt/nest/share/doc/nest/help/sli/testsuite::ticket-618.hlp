Name: testsuite::ticket-618 - catch nodes which require tau_mem != tau_syn

Synopsis: (ticket-618) run -> NEST exits if test fails

Description: 
All neuron models using exact integration require that tau_mem != tau_syn.
This test ensures that all pertaining models raise an exception if
tau_mem == tau_syn.

The test does so by ensuring that any model that has tau_* properties and V_m,
either throws an exception when all tau_ properties are set to the same value,
or has a non-nan V_m after 10ms simulation.

This test should be updated when alternative implementations of exact integration
for the degenerate case are in place.
