Name: GetConnections - Retrieve connections between nodes

   Synopsis:
   << /source [sgid1 sgid2 ...] 
      /target [tgid1 tgid2 ...]
      /synapse_model /smodel    >> GetConnections -> [ conn1 conn2 ... ]

   Parameters:
   A dictionary that may contain the following fields (all are optional):
   /source  - array with GIDs of presynaptic nodes whose connections are sought. 
              If not given, all neurons are searched as sources.
   /target  - array with GIDs of post-synaptic nodes whose connections are sought.
              If not given, all neurons are searched as targets.
   /synapse_model - literal specifying synapse model
                    If not given, connections of all synapse models are returned. 

   Description:
   1. If called with an empty dictionary, GetConnections returns all connections of the 
      network, as a list of arrays (IntVectorDatum), one array per connection.
   2. Each array (connection object) has the following elements:
      [source-gid target-gid target-thread synapse-model-id port]
   3. The optional dictionary elements /source and /target can be used to filter 
      for specific pre- and post-synaptic neurons, respectively.
   4. The optional parameter /synapse_model can be used to filter for a specific synapse model.
   5. In a parallel simulation, GetConnections only returns connections with *targets*
      on the MPI process executing the function. 

   Remarks:
   1. See synapsedict for the synapse-model-id's for all synapse models.
   2. The "port" enumerates connections per source, thread and synapse model. It is
      mainly important for NEST internally.
   3. In OpenMP mode, GetConnections works thread-parallel for better performance.
   4. Connection objects can be converted to SLI lists with cva.
   5. Connection objects can be passed to SetSynapseStatus, GetSynapseStatus, and DataConnect
