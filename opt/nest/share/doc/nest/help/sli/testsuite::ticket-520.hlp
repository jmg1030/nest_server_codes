Name: testsuite::ticket-520 - Ensure that multimeter returns correct number of time points in accumulator mode

Synopsis: (ticket-520) run -> NEST exits if test fails

Description:
When running in accumulator mode, multimeter must pick up the times array from only one thread,
so that value and times arrays have the same length.
