Name: testsuite::ticket-903 - Ensure delays are not strictly rounded up

Synopsis: (ticket-903) run -> NEST exits if test fails

Description:
This test ensures that delays drawn from continuous distribution are not
rounded up strictly.

Remarks: This test is probabilistic, so there is a minuscule chance of it
      failing even if all is well.
